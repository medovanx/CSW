		<p>Project managers are responsible for planning and overseeing projects to ensure they are completed in a
			timely fashion and within budget. Project managers plan and designate project resources, prepare budgets,
			monitor progress, and keep stakeholders informed the entire way. This is all done within the confines of a
			company's goals and vision. Project managers are needed on a wide variety of projects, including
			construction, IT, HR, and marketing.

			Project managers generally need to have a Bachelor's degree in computer science or business, as well as
			several years of experience in the relevant line of work with increasing responsibility. Many project
			managers choose to pursue a Project Management Professional (PMP) cerfication. To obtain a PMP
			certification, one must have a degree (associate's or Bachelor's), a certain number of hours leading and
			directing projects, a certain number of hours of project management education, pass an exam, and participate
			in ongoing professional development. Successful project managers are detail-oriented and have excellent
			communication skills.</p>
